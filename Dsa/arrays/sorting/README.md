# Sorting

## Bubble Sort

---

Bubble Sort is an algorithm that sorts an array from the lowest value to the highest value.

### Steps:
- Go through the array, one value at a time.
- For each value, compare it with the next value.
- If the current value is higher than the next one, swap the values so that the highest value moves to the end.
- Repeat this process as many times as there are values in the array.

## Selection Sort

---

Selection Sort is an algorithm that finds the lowest value in an array and moves it to the sorted part of the array.

### Steps:
- Go through the array to find the lowest value.
- Move the lowest value to the end of the sorted part of the array.
- Repeat this process for the remaining unsorted part as many times as there are values in the array.
