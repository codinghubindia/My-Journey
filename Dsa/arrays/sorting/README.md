<h1>Sorting</h1>
<br />
<h2>Bubble Sort </h2>
<hr />
<p>It is an Alogorithm that sorts an array from the lowest value to Higest value</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go through the array, one value at a time</li>
    <li>For each value, compare the value with the next value</li>
    <li>If the value is higher than the next one, swap the values so that the highest value comes last</li>
    <li>Go through the array as many times as there are values in the array</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Selection Sort</h2>
<hr />
<p>The Selection Sort algorithm finds the lowest value in an array and moves it to the sorted part of the array</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go through the array to find the lowest value</li>
    <li>Move the lowest value to the last of the sorted part of the array</li>
    <li>Go through the array again as many times as there are values in the array</li>
</ul>
